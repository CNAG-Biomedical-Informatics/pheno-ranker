# HIGH PRIORIY
* FileDir
* CPAN publication
* make it Public
* docs
* Docker
  
# Wishlist
* HPO ascendants (weights)
* Export to SQLite
  - directly?
  - via script that reads hashes

# Notes
* POSTgresl can have functions embeded (HD) | Vector DB for GPAP?
* Accept CSV (what happens with schema, ontologies, etc)
 - script external (csv2json from JS, Perl, Python)
 - code reads csv
* Can we use use JSON::Path or Mojo::JSON::Pointer to simplify stuff somewhere?
