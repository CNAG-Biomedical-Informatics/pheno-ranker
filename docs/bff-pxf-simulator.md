# BFF-PXF-SIMULATOR

=== "Explanation"

    We have developed a tool for generating **simulated** (synthetic) data in either [BFF](bff.md) or [PXF](pxf.md) formats. 

    The tool, `bff-pxf-simulator`, is included as an executable (if downloaded from CPAN) or found in the `utils` directory (if downloaded from GitHub or Docker).

    !!! Example "Potential uses for synthetic data"

        The simulated data can be used to:

        * Testing software and installations
        * Benchmarking
        * Sample classification
        * Outlier identification
        * ...
