!!! Hint "About other formats"
    The concept of Pheno-Ranker is to capitalize on the data harmonization provided by [GA4GH] standards. However, we aim to encourage widespread adoption, which is why we also offer support for other formats such as raw JSON/YAML and CSV.

=== "YAML / JSON"

     `Pheno-Ranker` _a priori_ accepts as input any JSON or YAML array file. In order to do it, you'll need a **configuration file**. See a tutorial on how to use it [here](tutorial.md#moviepackets).

=== "CSV"

     We developed an utility that converts **CSV** files to **JSON** and automatically creates the **configuration file** needed. See an example on how to use it [here](csv-import.md).
