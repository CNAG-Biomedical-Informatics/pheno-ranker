!!! Hint "About other formats"
    Pheno-Ranker leverages the data harmonization of **GA4GH** standards. However, to promote broader adoption, we also support other formats like raw JSON/YAML and CSV.

=== "YAML / JSON"

     `Pheno-Ranker` _a priori_ accepts as input any JSON or YAML array file. In order to do it, you'll need a **configuration file**. See a tutorial on how to use it [here](tutorial.md#moviepackets).

=== "CSV"

     We developed an utility that converts **CSV** files to **JSON** and automatically creates the **configuration file** needed. See an example on how to use it [here](csv-import.md).
